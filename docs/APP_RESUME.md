There’s still an issue with closing the app (to email, call) and then returning. And there are also a couple of new errors;
 
·         Problem with making call/email and then returning to app
To reproduce the error;
1.       Go into contact details
2.       Touch the phone no
3.       Go back into the app
4.       The app will start login again. This shouldn’t happen, it should just go back to the exact same position it was in earlier.
 
This also produces the same error
1.       Go into contact details
2.       Touch the email link
3.       Go back into the app
4.       The app will start login again. This shouldn’t happen, it should just go back to the exact same position it was in earlier.
 
·         Problem with cancelling damage report
To reproduce the error
1.       Start a damage report and register a few details
2.       Touch “Besiktning” in the menu. You should get a popup message saying “Do you want to cancel ongoing report”. But nothing happens.
 
·         Problem when internet access is missing
To reproduce the error
1.       Login to the app
2.       Activate flight mode
